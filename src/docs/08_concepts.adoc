=== Routes

The information stored, and showed in our application will be mostly about routes. A route represents a trajectory formed by different points on the real world. 

Routes can be stored and loaded from the Pod of each user independently of which application has created them. That is because, thanks to the link:https://github.com/Arquisoft/viadeSpec[ViadeSpec], we have defined an specification that grants interoperability with other route management systems.

Routes are shown to the user through two different interfaces: one where they are listed with the map and the most important data about them, and the other one with more specific data (such as images) that the user can see when accesing the routes details.
