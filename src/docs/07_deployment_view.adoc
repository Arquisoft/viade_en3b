Viade is a browser application, which means that it only requires:

* Solid's server: where the user's pod (and all its data) is stored.
* GitHub Pages server: the web hosting service where viade is deployed.
* Any web browser: we recommend using Chrome or Firefox because they are the ones used during development.
