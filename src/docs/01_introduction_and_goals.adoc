== Introduction and Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
Viade is a proyect that consists of a decentralized routes management system developed following solid specifications.

* Allow users to share information like pictures or videos about routes with the world at any time.
** The system will be decentralized. Data storage is separated from the app.
** Based on the React framework.
* Main quality goals are usability and maintainability. They will be described in a more detailed way in the next chapter.
* Teachers of Software Architecture and developers will be the stakeholders.

==== Developers: 

* Pablo Cañal Suárez. 
* Carmen Vigo Rodríguez.
* Miguel Cuesta Martínez.
* Lucía Megido García.
* Elena Rodríguez Río.

=== Requirements Overview

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The main requirements are:

* The system will be based on a decentralized architecture where data storage is separated from the app.
* Users can store their routes in their own pods.
* Users can view the routes stored on a map.
* The app will allow a user to share pictures, videos or information about a route with other friends.
* A user can get notifications when some friend shares a route with him.
* Users can have groups of friends with whom they may want to share a route
* It should be possible to view routes loaded by users that are using a different app, so interoperability with other route management systems should be taken into account.

.Motivation
The objective of Viade is to give users a platform where they can share their taste and opinions about the routes they take.
